               I Wasnt always a Coder/Software Engineer. I actually started out in life working with my hands in the trade industry. I come from a family of blue collar workers and its just something that I've always loved. To be skilled with my hands. I worked as a simple car mechanic, then moved on to trucks and diesel equipment and eventually working my way up the ladder into Power Generation.

                  I realize the trade life wasnt giving me a good work/life balance( working &lt 80 hours a week) and i wanted to spend more time with my daughter and less time on the road working ridiculous hours. It wasnt until i realized this when I was finally on vacation sitting on the beach enjoying the 1 week i had off a year that this is something i wanted to persue and do a career change.

               I used covid as an oppurtunity to do the switch in my career, I took the oppurtunity as a glass is half full and put my head into the books. (i still am obv.) But, here i am. Still learning new things along the way and just looking ot get my foot in the door somewhere to gain expierence and be a sponge whereever it is that i land a job. While working with my hands is my passion i am finding that its best to leave it as a hobby so that i dont kill my passion.
